* Inventory
** Replacements showing up with incorrect inventory amount
- issue: When I try to select a model as a replacement, even if there are serial models that are in stock, it will still show up as missing. 
- reproduce: ,add a serial fader to a quote, make it a PS, then try to susbtitute in CL5
24+8 Fader. It will still show as '-1'.
- workaround: Just deleting without going through the replacement utility.
